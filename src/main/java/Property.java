/**
 * This class is used to represent a property.
 * A common property in Norway has a municipality number, a municipality name, a lot number,
 * a section number, a name, an area, and a name of the owner.
 *
 * The constructor initializes a Property object with the following attributes:
 * @param municipalityNumber a unique Integer parameter for each municipality in Norway. This is a final attribute, because the property can not change its place.
 *                           The municipality number is in range from 101 (Halden) to 5054 (Indre Fosen).
 * @param municipalityName the name of the municipality. This is a final String parameter, because the name of the municipality most likely won't change.
 * @param lotNumber the lot number of the property. This is a final Integer attribute, because the lot number will not change.
 * @param sectionNumber the section number of the property. This is a final Integer attribute, because the section number will not change.
 * @param name the name of the property. Not all properties have a name, therefore this String is not set as final, and can be changed later.
 *             If the property is renamed for any reason, it can be changed with a mutator method. If the property does not have a name, the String will be empty.
 * @param area the area of the property. Property area is measured in square meters, and can be changed later, therefore it is not set as a final Double attribute.
 *             If the area of the property is measured incorrectly, or if the owners choose to buy more property, I use a mutator method to change it.
 * @param nameOfOwner The name of the owner of the property. Property owners can change, therefore this is not set as a final String, and
 *                    that is also why I have made a mutator method for this attribute.
